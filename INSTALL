Installation instructions
=========================

After cloning the repository, the platform is not yet ready to go. You must run
the ./install/install.sh script which download the missing components (like
disk images and benchmark sources) finalize the installation.

The install operation should be local only. The install scripts will ask you
for sudo password several times. This is required to pack the banchmark
components into virtual disks.
